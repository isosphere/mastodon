# Some migrations have been present in glitch-soc for a long time and have then
# been merged in upstream Mastodon, under a different version number.
#
# This puts us in an uneasy situation in which if we remove upstream's
# migration file, people migrating from upstream will end up having a conflict
# with their already-ran migration.
#
# On the other hand, if we keep upstream's migration and remove our own,
# any current glitch-soc user will have a conflict during migration.
#
# For lack of a better solution, as those migrations are indeed identical,
# we decided monkey-patching Rails' Migrator to completely ignore the duplicate,
# keeping only the one that has run, or an arbitrary one.
